## A Mobile AR Educational Game

It is a marker-based AR game prototype developed with [Futuclass](https://futuclass.com/).
The 3D models are provided by Futuclass. I am the solo developer for this project.

It is also the work for my Master thesis in University of Tartu.

It is fully workable on the iOS platform and available for some device models of the Android platforms.

Its content is currently available in Estonian only. If you are interested please contact futuclass for a testing session.(mailto:info@futuclass.com)

Tool and framework used: Unity, C#, AR Foundation, Figma, Miro, ARKit, ARCore, VS, Xcode


This is a short video of my work. A screen recoding from my iPhone 11. Enjoy!
