Talking about self-intro is always like an advertisement. I do not like it personally. Since you are now visiting this post, you should be interested in me or something I can offer = )

I am a game enthusiast. I love anime and RPG games. My favourite cartoon is Pokemon. I completed all the main stream games (MSG) and watched all the movies. When I was small, I would like to study the different stats behind different pokemon species. Like most of the trainers, I like to use strong monsters and evolve them into their final forms.

During my high school years, I started to realize that the numerical system of this collection game is so realistic. I always wish to be a Mewtwo but not a Pikachu LOL. The fact is that the base stats values and individual values of a pokemon could not be changed by training but only the effort values could be changed. This means that a Pikachu could never become a Mewtwo but at least a Pikachu could become a stronger Pikachu.

Yup, knowing your strengths and weaknesses is important to make better use of your time and effort to win this game (life). The personality of a pokemon is also important. It acts as a multiplier to the final stats. For me, I am an ESTP person who is rational, practical and sociable. These are some good things but the weaknesses for ESTP like impatience and unstructured are also true, which are some things I have to always remind myself.
