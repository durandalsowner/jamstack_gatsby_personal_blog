Talking about self-intro is always like an advertisement. I do not like it personally. Since you are now visiting this post, you should be interested in me or something I can offer = )

I am a game enthusiast. I was addicted to anime and RPG games when I was small. Pokemon is my favourite. I completed all the MSG series and watched all the movies.
When I was small, I would like to study the different stats behind different pokemon species.

When I was in high school, I understood that the numerical system of this collection game is so realistic and I always wish to be a Mewtwo but not a Pikachu LOL. The base stats values and individual values of a pokemon could not be changed with effort but only the effort values could be changed by effort. This means that a Pikachu could never become a Mewtwo but at least a Pikachu could become a stronger Pikachu.

Yup, knowing your strengths and weaknesses is important to make better use of your time and effort to win this game (life). The personality of a pokemon is also important. It acts as a multiplier to the final stats. For me, I am an ESTP person who is rational, practical and sociable. These are some good things but the weaknesses for ESTP like impatience and unstructured are also true, which are some things I have to always remind myself.
