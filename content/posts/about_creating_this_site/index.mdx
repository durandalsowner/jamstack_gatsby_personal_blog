### What is Jamstack?

Many of you should have known web platforms like wordpress and wix.com.
Or other traditional web development frameworks like Angular, React, ASP.net.

Entering 2020, there is a revolution in web development industory happening and that is Jamstack.

It emphasizes that the blog data and the template are all separated. The data could be archieved from anywhere through graphql.
In Gatsbyjs, those blog data updates are done in mdx data file with markup. While the UI and CSS styles of the pages are generated webpack by loading those React compoents.
For more detail, please read the recommended reading at the bottom of this page.

### My experience and thoughts

Before trying out jamstack, I have completed several web application projects using asp.net webform and MVC framework,
 and PHP frameworks like wordpress.org and Magento. Comparing with them, jamstack is easier to be picked up at first, it is lightweight and with many beautiful templates which could be chosen from.
 However, for template modification and functional changes, it was not easy to start without reading tutorials or any react programming background knowledge.
 It took me some time to learn how those plug-ins work, and modify the compoment part.

Generally speaking, I am really eocouraging anyone who are interested in website creation to try out JAMstack. If you could find a template started which suits your needs perfectly, then everything woudl be fine without any coding modification.
Otherwise, it should be a challenge and still it is worth to learn and try. For React developer, it should be a cup of tea =)
